# Escape the Room Game
### Vicky McDermott and Camille Xue

## Project Idea Description
For this project we will be creating an interactive, text-based game in the terminal. It will be an “escape room” game, where the player will try different interaction commands to escape the room. Our stretch goal is to create multiple endings based on the decisions the player makes. Our lower bound is a basic straightforward escape room that is easy to complete, and the game has preset commands to choose from.

## Learning Goals
We want to learn more about strings and how strings work in C. We want to learn about how we can manipulate strings and how pointers to strings and char arrays work. By making a terminal based game, we will also learn how to be more familiar with working with special characters.

## Resources
We have found a tutorial online for NCURSES, which will help in formatting our game in the terminal: [NCURSES link](https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/ncurses-intro.html).
Another resource that we will reference is ELIZA, which is our inspiration for the game: [ELIZA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA).

## First Steps
* One of our first steps is to read the NCURSES tutorial.
* Next, we will implement a "hello world" version of our terminal game where it simply says hello to the person who is interacting with the game.
* Brainstorm and plan our escape room and the solution. This will be considered done when we have our basic room with two to three challenges that need to be completed for escape.
